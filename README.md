Welcome to **Acme Rockets**!  
This is a simple, responsive, single-page website built to help me learn and practice [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## ✨ Features

- **Responsive Design:** Looks great on all devices.
- **Modern UI:** Built entirely with Tailwind CSS utility classes.
- **Sticky Header & Mobile Menu:** Navigation adapts for mobile with a hamburger menu.
- **Sections:**
  - Hero section
  - Rockets showcase
  - Testimonials
  - Contact form
  - Footer with address and quick links
- **Dark Mode Ready:** Uses Tailwind’s dark mode utilities.
